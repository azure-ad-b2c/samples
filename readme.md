# Azure Active Directory B2C: Custom CIAM User Journeys

In this repo, you will find samples for several enhanced Azure AD B2C Custom CIAM User Journeys.

## Getting started

- See our [Azure AD B2C Wiki articles](https://github.com/azure-ad-b2c/ief-wiki/wiki) here to help walkthrough the custom policy components.

- See our Custom Policy Documentation [here](https://aka.ms/ief).

- See our Custom Policy Schema reference [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory-b2c/active-directory-b2c-reference-trustframeworks-defined-ief-custom).

## Prerequisites

- You can automate the pre requisites by visiting this [site](https://aka.ms/iefsetup). Some policies can be deployed directly through this app via the **Experimental** menu.

- You will require to create an Azure AD B2C directory, see the guidance [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory-b2c/tutorial-create-tenant).

- To use the sample policies in this repo, follow the instructions here to setup your AAD B2C environment for Custom Policies [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory-b2c/active-directory-b2c-get-started-custom).

- For any custom policy sample which makes use of Extension attributes, follow the guidance [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory-b2c/active-directory-b2c-create-custom-attributes-profile-edit-custom#create-a-new-application-to-store-the-extension-properties) and [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory-b2c/active-directory-b2c-create-custom-attributes-profile-edit-custom#modify-your-custom-policy-to-add-the-applicationobjectid). The `AAD-Common` Technical profile will always need to be modified to use your `ApplicationId` and `ObjectId`.

## Local account policy enhancements

- [Password reset via Email or Phone verification](policies/pwd-reset-via-email-or-phone) - This demonstrates how to verify a user via Email or SMS on a single screen.

- [Sign In and Sign Up with Username or Email](policies/username-or-email) - This sample combines the UX of both the Email and Username based journeys.

- [Split Sign-up into separate steps for email verification and account creation](policies/split-email-verification-and-signup) - When you don't want to use the default Sign-up page which shows both email verification and user registration controls on the same page at once. This sample splits the default sign-up behavior into two separate steps. First step performs Email Verification only, avoiding all other default fields related to users registration. Second step (if email verification was successful) takes the users to a new screen where they can actually create their accounts. This uses Azure AD to send out emails, no separate email provider integrations needed.

- [Provide consent UI to API scopes](policies/service-consent) - For scenarios where you provide a plug and play service to other partners. When the user chooses to use your service through a partner application, the user must login with their account with your service, and consent to various scopes which allow your service to share information with the partner application.

- [Sign Up and Sign In with dynamic 'Terms of Use' prompt](policies/sign-in-sign-up-versioned-tou) - Demonstrates how to incorporate a TOU or T&Cs into your user journey with the ability for users to be prompted to re-consent when the TOU/T&Cs change.

- [Local account change sign-in name email address](policies/change-sign-in-name) - During sign-in with a local account, a user may want to change the sign-in name (email address). This sample policy demonstrates how to allow a user to provide and validate a new email address, and store the new email address to the Azure Active Directory user account. After the user changes their email address, subsequent logins require the use of the new email address.

- [Password-less sign-in with email verification](policies/passwordless-email) - Password-less authentication is a type of authentication where user doesn't need to sign-in with their password. This is commonly used in B2C scenarios where users use your application infrequently and tend to forget their password. This sample policy demonstrates how to allow user to sign-in, simply by providing and verifying the sign-in email address using OTP code (one time password).

- [Custom email verification - DisplayControls](policies/custom-email-verifcation-displaycontrol) - Allows you to send your own custom email verification email during sign-up or password reset user journey's. The is a working example of the sample reference on the Microsoft B2C documentation site - [Custom email verification in Azure Active Directory B2C](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory-b2c/custom-email)

- [Custom SMS provider - DisplayControls](policies/custom-sms-displaycontrol) Integrate a custom SMS provider in Azure Active Directory B2C (Azure AD B2C) to customized SMS' to users that perform multi factor authentication to your application. By using DisplayControls (currently in preview) and a third-party SMS provider, you can use your own contextualised SMS message, custom Phone Number, as well as support localization and custom one-time password (OTP) settings.

- [Force password reset](policies/force-password-reset) - As an administrator, you can reset a user's password if the user forgets their password. Or you would like to force them to reset the password. In this policy sample, you'll learn how to force a password reset in these scenarios.

- [Force password reset first logon](policies/force-password-reset-first-logon) - Demonstrates how to force a user to reset their password on the first logon.

- [Sign-up and sign-in with embedded password reset](policies/embedded-password-reset) - This policy demonstrates how to embed the password reset flow a part of the sign-up or sign-in policy without the AADB2C90118 error message.

- [Embedded Sign-up and sign-in with iframe](policies/embedded-sign-in) - This policy demonstrates how to allow your Azure AD B2C user interface to be embedded in an iframe.

- [Force password after 90 days](policies/force-password-reset-after-90-days) - Demonstrates how to force a user to reset their password after 90 days from the last time user set their password.

- [Password reset only](policies/password-reset-only) - This example policy prevents issuing an access token to the user after resetting their password.

- [Username discovery](policies/username-discovery) - This example shows how to discover a username by email address. It's useful when a user forgot their username and remembers only their email address.

- [Azure AD B2C Invitation](policies/invite) - This sample console app demonstrates how to send a sign-up email invitation. After you sent the invitation, the user clicks on the **Confirm account** link, which opens the sign-up page (without the need to validate the email again). Use this approach when you need to create the users account beforehand, while allowing the user to choose the password on initial sign in. This approach is better than creating an account via Graph API and sending the password to the user via some communication means.

- [Email Verification at Sign In](policies/signin-email-verification) - For scenarios where you would like users to validate their email via TOTP on every sign in.

- [Google Captcha on Sign In](policies/captcha-integration) - An example set of policies which integrate Google Captcha into the sign in journey.

- [Login with Phone Number](policies/signup-signin-with-phone-number) - An example set of policies for password-less login via Phone Number (SMS or Phone Call).

- [Password Reset with Phone Number](policies/password-reset-with-phone-number) - An example policy to reset a users password using Phone Number (SMS or Phone Call).

- [Password reset without the ability to use the last password](policies/password-reset-not-last-password) - For scenarios where you need to implement a password reset/change flow where the user cannot use their currently set password.

- [Disable and lockout an account after a period of inactivity](policies/disable-inactive-account) - For scenarios where you need to prevent users logging into the application after a set number of days. The account will also be disabled at the time of the users login attempt in the case the user logs in after the time period.

- [Email delivered account redemption link](policies/sign-in-with-email) - This sample demonstrates how to allow the user to sign up to a web application by providing their email which sends the user a magic link to complete their account creation to their email.

- [Sign-in with a magic link](policies/sign-in-with-magic-link) - This sample demonstrates how a user can sign in to your web application by sending them a sign-in link. A magic link can be used to pre-populate user information, or accelerate the user through the user journey.

- [Banned password list](policies/banned-password-list-no-API) - For scenarios where you need to implement a sign up and password reset/change flow where the user cannot use a new password that is part of a banned password list. This sample does not use an API.

- [Impersonation Flow](policies/impersonation) - For scenarios where you require one user to impersonate another user. This is common for support desk or delegated administration of a user in an application or service. It is recommended to always issue the token of the original authenticated user and append additional information about the targeted impersonated user as part of the auth flow

- [Sign-in with FIDO](policies/fido2) - Demonstrates how to sign-in with a FIDO authenticator (as a first factor authentication). This policy use the WebAuthn standard to register new credential and sign-in with FIDO credential.

- [Sign-in with Home Realm Discovery and Default IdP](policies/default-home-realm-discovery) - Demonstrates how to implement a sign in journey, where the user is automatically directed to their federated identity provider based off of their email domain. And for users who arrive with an unknown domain, they are redirected to a default identity provider.

- [Terms of Service with Sign-in or Sign-up](policies/terms-of-service) - Demonstrates how to implement Terms of Service within a SUSI experience. This policy writes a configurable policy version onto an attribute stored in the directory. If you update the version within the policy, it will prompt the user during the next login to force the user to accept the new terms of service agreement.

- [sign-up or sign-in policy with a link to sign-up page](policies/susi-with-link-to-sign-up) - Adds a direct link to the sign-up page. A relying party application can include a query string parameter that takes the user directly to the sign-up page.

- [sign-up or sign-in policy checks if client Id is allowed to call the policy](policies/allow-list-applications) - Checks if the application is allowed to call the b2c sign-in sign-up policy. Uses a claims resolver to get the client ID from the incoiming OIDC request, and uses a claims transformation to see if the client id is on an allow list of application ID's.  If the client Id is not on the allowed list, a customizable error message on a block page is shown to the user, blocking access to the policy.

## Social account policy enhancements

- [Social identity provider force email verification](policies/social-idp-force-email) - When a user signs in with a social account, in some scenarios, the identity provider doesn't share the email address. This sample demonstrates how to force the user to provide and validate an email address.

- [Dynamic identity provider selection](policies/idps-filter) - Demonstrates how to dynamically filter the list of social identity providers rendered to the user based on the requests application ID. In the following screenshot user can select from the list of identity providers, such as Facebook, Google+ and Amazon. With Azure AD B2C custom policies, you can configure the technical profiles to be displayed based a claim's value. The claim value contains the list of identity providers to be rendered.

- [Home Realm Discovery page](policies/home-realm-discovery-modern) - Demonstrates how to create a home realm discovery page. On the sign-in page, the user provides their sign-in email address and clicks continue. B2C checks the domain portion of the sign-in email address. If the domain name is `contoso.com` the user is redirected to Contoso.com Azure AD to complete the sign-in. Otherwise the user continues the sign-in with username and password. In both cases (AAD B2C local account and AAD account), the user does not need to retype the user name.

- [Sign-in with social identity provider and force email uniqueness](policies/force-unique-email-across-social-identities) - Demonstrates how to force a social account user to provide and validate their email address, and also checks that there is no other account with the same email address.

- [Account linkage](policies/account-linkage-unified) - (new version, one policy for both link and unlink) - With Azure AD B2C an account can have multiple identities, local (username and password) or social/enterprise identity (such as Facebook or AAD). This Azure AD B2C sample demonstrates how to link and unlink existing Azure AD B2C account to a social identity. Unified policy for link and unlink.

- [Account linkage](policies/account-linkage) - (a policy for link and another policy for unlink.) - With Azure AD B2C an account can have multiple identities, local (username and password) or social/enterprise identity (such as Facebook or AAD). This Azure AD B2C sample demonstrates how to link and unlink existing Azure AD B2C account to a social identity.

- [Link a local account to federated account](policies/link-local-account-with-federated-account) - Demonstrates how to link a user who logged in via a federated provider to a pre-created AAD B2C Local Account.

- [Preventing logon for Social or External IdP Accounts when Disabled in AAD B2C](policies/disable-social-account-from-logon) - For scenarios where you would like to prevent logons via Social or External IdPs when the account has been disabled in Azure AD B2C.

The flow prompts the user to store a secondary phone if only one phone number is one file. Once the two numbers are stored as part of SignUp or SignIn the user is given a choice to select between the two phones for their MFA on subsequent signIns.

- [MFA after timeout or IP change](policies/mfa-absolute-timeout-and-ip-change-trigger) - A policy which forces the user to do MFA on 3 conditions:

  1. The user has newly signed up.
  2. The user has not done MFA in the last X seconds.
  3. The user is logging in from a different IP than they last logged in from.

- [Unknown Devices MFA](policies/mfa-unknown-devices) - Demonstrates how to detect unknown devices which might be required to prompt MFA as illustrated in this particular sample or send email to the user signing in from unknown device.

## User interface enhancements

- [Render dynamic dropdown box](policies/selectemail) - For scenarios where you would like to fetch information during the runtime of the authentication flow, and display this data as a dropdown box dynamically for the user to make a selection. In this example, a users identifier is sent to an API, which returns a set of emails for them to select. The selected email is returned in the token.
