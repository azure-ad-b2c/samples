In this repo, you will find samples for several enhanced Azure AD B2C Custom CIAM User Journeys.

## Getting started

- See our [Custom Policy overview](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory-b2c/custom-policy-overview).

- See our [Azure AD B2C Wiki articles](https://azure-ad-b2c.github.io/azureadb2ccommunity.io/docs/custom-policy-concepts/) to help walkthrough the custom policy components.
