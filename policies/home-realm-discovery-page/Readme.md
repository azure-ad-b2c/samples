# Azure AD B2C: Home Realm Discovery page
This sample custom policy demonstrates how to create home realm discovery page. On the sign-in page user provides the sign-in email address and clicks continue. B2C checks the domain portion of the sign-in email address. If the domain name is `contoso.com` the user is redirected to Contoso.com Azure AD to complete the sign-in. Otherwise the user continues the sign-in with user name and password. In both cases (AAD B2C local account and AAD account), the user dons't need to retype the user name. 

 User flow:
1. On the sign-in page user provides the sign-in email address and clicks continue. 
1. B2C extracts the domain portion of the sign-in email address (also change to lower case). 
1. Based on the domain name, user continues with:
    1. Redirect to an enterprise Azure AD tenant to complete the sign-in.
    1. Sign-in as a local account (user name and password)
